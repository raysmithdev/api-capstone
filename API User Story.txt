App Purpose:
A highly, customizeable, organizational application.

App Idea:
The app is a customizeable planner.  The user can keep track of any and everything they might want to for the day, week,
month, or even year.  The basic layout of the app will allow the user to store specific events and day-to-day tasks in the
calendar, but it also allows for the user to store other information (i.e. reading, eating, and excercising habits, to-do
lists, grocery lists, year-end goals, weekly goals, movies to watch, books to read, etc...). All while allowing the user
to organize these ideas and lists in a way that makes sense to them.
